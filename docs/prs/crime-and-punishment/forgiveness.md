## Religious Views

### Christianity

#### The Bible

> Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us
>
> — The Lord's Prayer

> Forgive them Father, they do not know what they are doing
>
> — The Crucifixion

**The Story of the Adultress:** Jesus stopped the stoning of an adultress and forgave her.  
**The Story of the Prodigal Son:** If somebody is genuinely sorry, they should be forgiven.

#### Anthony Walker Case

In 2005, Anthony Walker was murdered in a racially motivated attack. His family was Christian, and eventually forgave the attackers.

> For if you forgive people their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
>
> — Matthew 6:14

The family said it was 'not up to \[them\]' to take revenge and that it helped them move on.

### Buddhism

Hate is one of the Three Poisons, and it should be let go by the victims. Buddhists believe that instead they should meditate. Buddhists say that forgiving somebody is like dropping a hot coal, and it does not mean that the victim will not be punished: they will be punished by the justice system and kamma.
