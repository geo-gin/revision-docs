## Aims

:::warning

The [AQA Spec](https://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/religious-studies/gcse/religious-studies-8062/specification/subject-content/component-2-thematic-studies#Religion_and_punishment) requires you to call the aims of punishment 'retribution', 'deterrence' and 'reformation'. For example, do not call 'retribution' 'revenge' or 'reformation' 'rehabilitation'.

:::

### Retribution

Retribution is getting revenge for what the criminal did. This usually involves doing the same thing (or something of a similar severity) to a criminal as what the criminal did to their victims. It is done by society on behalf of the victim.

It is usually done via [corporal punishment](./glossary.md#corporal-punishment) (like the [death penalty](./glossary.md#death-penalty)).

**Examples:**
* Imprisonment
* [Death penalty](./glossary.md#death-penalty)
* Stoning
* Loss of body part

:::tip[Christian View]

Some Chrisitians support the [death penalty](./glossary.md#death-penalty), quoting:

> If there is a serious injury you are to take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth
>
> — Exodus

However, most interpret this as that murderers should be severely punished instead.  
Many Christians are against the [death penalty](./glossary.md#death-penalty) due to the Sanctity of Life.

:::tip[Buddhist View]

Buddhists view that [corporal punishment](./glossary.md#corporal-punishment) is wrong because it is a form of violence. They believe that a person will suffer anyway due to the principle of kamma.

:::

### Deterrence

The punishment is severe to make would-be offenders change their minds. For example, somebody that has been jailed for a long time would be less likely to re-offend to avoid being jailed again.  
In the past, there was public floggings and executions. In modern day Britain this is widely seen as unacceptable, but it is [still done in some countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_executions_in_Iran).

**Examples:**
* Imprisonment
* [Death penalty](./glossary.md#death-penalty)
* Stoning
* Fines
* Public humiliation

:::tip[Christian View]

Many Christians oppose public punishments because they humiliate the offender, and all humans should be treated with respect regardless of their actions.

:::

### Reformation

The criminal is shown the error of their ways and changed into a better person. This helps criminals reintegrate into society and is supported by most religions. However, it doesn't work for everybody.

**Examples:**
* Therapy
* Community service
* Education

:::tip[Christian View]

A criminal should be able to change, apologise, and repent.

:::

:::tip[Buddhist View]

> Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good

There shouldn't be any revenge and the criminal should instead be shown compassion.
