## Views

### Christianity

Some Christians are in favour of the death penalty, quoting the Old Testament:

> If there is a serious injury you are to take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth

> Whoever sheds human blood, by humans shall their blood be shed

However, most Christians oppose it. They view it as a form of murder and against the Sanctity of Life. They believe that everybody should have the chance to change and repent.

### Buddhism

Buddhists are told to follow the laws of your country, however are against the death penalty, quoting:

> Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good

They see [corporal punishment](./glossary.md#corporal-punishment) and the death penalty as a form of violence, which is strictly prohibited by the First Moral Precept.

### Utilitarianism

Utilitarianists believe in the Principle of Utility, that says that actions should give the most amount of happiness to the most amount of people. They believe that the suffering of one person (the criminal) is justifiable if it causes more happiness for society.
