## Prisons

### In the United Kingdom

Prisons in the UK have a main aim of [deterrence](./aims-of-punishment.md#deterrence). There are many issues the system has been criticised for:

* Conditions in most prisons are poor, affecting mental health poorly.
  * 86 inmate suicides a year
  * March 2025 had record self harm rates: 899 incidents per 1000 prisoners per year
* Because there is little [reformation](./aims-of-punishment.md#reformation), many are locked in a loop of reoffending.
  * 32% of prisoners are reoffenders
* The punishment can be seen as too harsh for many people — 61% of sentences are for non-violent or petty crimes
* Costs ~£36,237 per prisoner per year (only a bit less than the UK median salary)

### In Norway

Prisons in Norway have a main aim of [reformation](./aims-of-punishment.md#reformation). It has been subject to debate on whether or not it is a good idea:

* Prison guards are instead called 'officers' to promote more friendliness betweeen them and inmates
* Officers take part in activities with inmates
* Reoffence in 2 years is only 20%, whilst the UK's is almost 50% in one year
* Nowegian prisons have won awards for their design and architecture
* Costs ~£98,000 per prisoner per year

### In Russia

Prisons in Russia have a main aim of [deterrence](./aims-of-punishment.md#deterrence) and [retribution](./aims-of-punishment.md#retribution). They are widely criticised for their extreme and 'concentration-camp'-like conditions:

* Political prisoners are held there
* There is no privacy for inmates, either with other inmates or guards
* Russia has one of the highest incarceration rates in Europe
* Hard labour is common
* No rest is allowed between 6am to 10pm
* TVs are allowed, but they are controlled to play propaganda
