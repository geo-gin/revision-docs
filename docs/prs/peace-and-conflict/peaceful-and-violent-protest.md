## Right to Protest in the UK

The Right to Protest is considered a fundamental democratic freedom. UK law allows individuals and groups to publically demonstrate. However, for marches:
* Police must be told at least 6 days in advance
* Police can request alternative routes
* Police can request a court order to stop the march if:
  * The march may intimidate people
  * The police predicts violence
* There is no legal right to [violent protest](./glossary.md#violent-protest), and it is usually illegal
