## In Christianity

The Religious Society of Friends (or Quakers) is a Christian denomination that strongly supports pacifism. In WWI and WWII they were [conscientious objectors](./glossary.md#conscientious-objector) and campaign against war, conflict and nuclear weapons.

>
> — Matthew 5:9

> Do not murder
>
> — Exodus 20:13

Other Christian pacifist groups include the Amish and mennonites.

## In Buddhism

Buddhist teachings strongly promote pacifism. The First Moral Precept teaches Buddhists not to harm or kill any living being. The Buddha taught that Buddhists should develop kindess and compassion for all beings and that violence should be avoided. It is also taught that to live in peace, Buddhists must try to create a world that favours peaceful states of mind.

### The Parable of the Saw

> Suppose, says the Buddha, that bandits were to tear you limb from limb with a monstrous saw. Even if in a circumstance such as this, people give way to hatred. If they do this, they cannot say they are Buddhist

This teaches that Buddhists should avoid all violence always.
