A 'refuge' is something used by Buddhists to relieve suffering. They are 'seeking refuge' from suffering. They are also known as the **Three Jewels**.  
They are:

1. The Buddha
2. Dhamma
3. Sangha

In many traditions, it is common to recite the Three Refuges at the start of a Buddhist event:

> To the Buddha for refuge I go  
> To the Dhamma for refuge I go  
> To The Sangha for refuge I go

## Dhamma (or Dharma)

The Dhamma has a few different meanings:

1. The 'truth' about the nature of existence that the Buddha realised when he became enlightened. Some examples are:
    * The Four Noble Truths
    * The Three Marks of Existence
2. The path of training recommended by the Buddha to become enlightened
3. It is sometimes translated as 'law'. This isn't as in rules to be followed, but a universal law about how things are (like Newton's law of gravity).

## Sangha

The Sangha has a few different meanings:

1. Those who have become enlightened by following the Buddha's teachings
2. Monks and nuns
3. All those who follow the Buddha's teachings
